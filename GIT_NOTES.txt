If you're annoyed by having to enter your password every time you git push,
there are a couple options.

Option 1: configure git to cache your password in memory for some time. See:
    https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/

Option 2: clone the repository using SSH instead of HTTPS. In this case you'll
use an SSH key instead of a password. This is more complicated. See:
    https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/
