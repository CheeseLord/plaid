Before pushing anything to master, make sure it builds and passes all tests.

Create a ticket associated with each FIXME or TODO.

Every piece of code must be understood by at least two people.

Use unit tests and contracts wherever possible.
Structure code so that as much as possible is testable.

Tag things pure where possible.
